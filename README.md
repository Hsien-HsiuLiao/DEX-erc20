## Summary
This is a decentralized exchange (DEX) for ERC20 tokens. DAI Stablecoin used as quote currency. Before users can trade, they first need to transfer their Ether to the DEX smart contract by using the Wallet component of the DEX UI. Then, 
users can create limit or market buy/sell orders for BAT/REP/ZRX mock tokens. Orders will be displayed in All Orders component. If there is a match, trade will be executed and the All Trades component will update the chart and the table for amount/price/date. User will also see My Orders component with their BUY/SELL orders and update when orders are filled.
